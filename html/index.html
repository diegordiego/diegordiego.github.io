            <section class="fs-5">
              <p>Alpura is one of Mexico's biggest dairy producers, with plans to start exporting their products in the
                near future. Their HQ is located in Mexico City.</p>
              <p>Each Monday, the board of directors would have a Videoconference with two other plants, one located in
                San Luis Potosí and the other one in Chihuahua, through a very rudimentary system and the Director would
                always complain about how hard it was to use, how very inefficient, and in general, how it wasn't good
                for
                what they needed. On top of that, someone from IT would always have to be there to set up the VC and
                would
                loose valuable time, that could otherwise be used in their actual responsibilities.</p>
              <p>The project consisted in replacing the old VC system for one that performed as it should.</p>
              <p>A compact PC was put in place, to have a dedicated "soft codec" for the room. Three "DCM-1"
                microphones,
                along with a TesiraForté VT4 were installed and programmed to handle the audio, achieving a full
                coverage
                of the room, with great voice intelligibility and without unwanted noise. A PTZ camera was connected
                through USB to have a clear image of the participants and an 80" semi-pro monitor was mounted so that
                the
                far side could be seen without any issues.
                A Click-Share from BARCO was also installed to allow for presentations without the need of physical
                cables.</p>
